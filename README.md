# InstallMonitor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChriZ982/InstallMonitor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChriZ982/InstallMonitor)

This c++ application is designed to create snapshots of the filesystem and compare them. It should be possible to monitor what files are changed during any installation processes so that they can be reverted later.
